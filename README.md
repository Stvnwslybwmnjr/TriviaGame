# TriviaGame
https://stvnwslybwmnjr.github.io/TriviaGame/

This trivia game was my first exposure to the javascript clock features. This project turn out really nicely, There's only a few questions but I wrote the code so you can add more questions and it wont affect the proper functioning of the game! I tried to add funny sounds depending on whether you answered correctly but it wasn't working. It was odd because I had sounds in my last homework. I'll come back and put those in eventually.

I gave it a classy look to match the theme of classic literature. Hope you like it!
